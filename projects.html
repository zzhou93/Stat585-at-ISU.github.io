<h2>Final  projects</h2>

This class requires a presentation and a report for a final project. Final projects are team-based with teams consisting of 3 to 5 members.

<p>For the final project you are asked to create an R package. You are free to choose package functionality, but there should be</p>
<ul>
<li>a minimum of five functions with a coherent theme,</li>
<li>a shiny app show-casing some of the functionality</li>
<li>a website for the package</li>
<li>a README page with installation instructions and basic demonstration of functionality</li>
<li>evidence of testing the functionality</li>
<li>8-10 page report detailing your work. This report should be written as a package vignette, included in your package’s documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are asked to present your work as a team in one of the speaking slots during dead week and finals’ week. Each team member is supposed to present for about 5 mins.</p>

There are several stages to the project. Only the last two stages are graded. All other stages are not graded. You should use them as an opportunity to get feedback.

For stages 1-3 feedback will be given as soon as you submit your contribution, i.e. you don't have to wait until after Spring break to submit your project idea.

<ul>
  <li>
Stage 1 (by Mar 27, not graded): Identify team and topic
  </li><li>
Stage 2 (by Apr 10, not graded): Functional Package
  </li><li>
Stage 3 (by Apr 24, not graded): Testing and Documentation
  </li><li>
Stage 4: Presentation (Dead week and Finals, graded)
  </li><li>
Stage 5 (May 9th, graded): Package submission to canvas (Finals week)
  </li>
</ul>

We will be using the following <a href="project-rubric.html">project rubric</a> for evaluating the final submission.

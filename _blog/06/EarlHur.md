## My Website:

https://earl88.github.io/

## Challenges:

I have been always eager to build my own website and this was my first time building my own (finally!). Although this is not a fancy website yet, I will try to put more stuff in my website such as my teaching materials or statistics classes materials that I have taken. The biggest challenge that I ran into was to push this html file to the web address. First thing that I (always) had to do was commit the change. I forgot this and try to push and nothing happened. The second problem was up upload my CV. Without knowing that there is a simple way to update the pdf file, I looked at the stack-exchange website to get help. Nothing worked but just simply add the file into my github repository.

**1. Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong.**

The case I choose is about plagiarism, as shown in the following link:

<https://retractionwatch.com/2019/01/09/cribbing-from-kribbe-uk-criminology-prof-loses-four-papers-for-plagiarism/>.

A professor of criminology at Middlesex University London has four papers retracted because at least three of the papers were accused for crribbing from a PhD thesis. The papers reused some parts of the PhD thesis without permission and acknowledgement. So they are retracted.

**2. After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

I'm most likely to follow Rule 2 and Rule 6. Rule 6 is relatively simple and easy to follow without changing too much of the current custom. Rule 2 is about data manipulation and this is what we are learning. As a graduate student in statistics, I should definitely follow this.

The one that is most difficult to follow for me is the Rule 1, which asks us to keep track for every result. Generally, I only track those main results that I want to show. Track every result is more time consuming, and considering that I need to make up a standardized format for that, it is even more complex.

1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 

"Food packaging journal to retract paper by researchers in Thailand"
The paper I picked is "Production, characterization and controlled release studies of biodegradable polymer microcapsules incorporating neem seed oil by spray drying" by the journal of Food Packaging & Shelf Life. There are sections which have appeared in Polymer Bulletin in title of “Core shell microcapsules of neem seed oil extract containing azadirachtin and biodegradable polymers and their release characteristics” which had been published about 4 months before this paper by the same first author. This kind of duplication can be called "self-plagiarism". But now I can still see the paper in the Food packaging journal online without retraction.

2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

I'm most likely to follow Rule 7: Always Store Raw Data behind Plots. I think we always should store the raw data in our research work. So we can go back and check the data anytime when we encounter some problems.
Rule 10 is the hardest for me to follow. On one side, you can use the published data to supplement your own research, like to do some comparisons with prior work. On the other, in some hot topics, other people in a big team who do similar things as yours can soon exceed your research process under the help of your published data.

1. **Under what license does R operate?**

 GPL-2|GPL-3 license
2. **Answer the three questions listed above for the licenses: MIT, GPL-3,  LGPL-3, and CC-0. Note that some of the questions might not be answered with a simple yes/no. In that case, go into more detail, but do not just copy the terms of the license.**

**MIT**: 


   1- Are you and your collaborators fine with other people modifying your work and then sharing the modified work?
   yes under this licence people can modify,and distribute it

   2- Are you and your collaborators fine with other people making a profit from those derivations?
   yes commericial use is ok,it says that anybody can do whathever they want as long as they include nclude the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source

   3- Who is responsible if your software does not do what it promises to do?
the licence is as it is, so nobody is responsible i guess but generally the author , creator and copywrite should be responsible

**GPL-3**
1- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
2-yes
3-

**LGPL-3**
1-Derivatives works (including modifications or anything statically linked to the library) can only be redistributed under LGPL but applications that use the library don't have to be.
2-yes it has commercial use
3-

**CC-0**
1-yes
2-yes
3-the "Affirmer"

3. **Assume that you are in the process of making a package for your own graduate work. Describe considerations that come into play in deciding on a license. In case you are not quite at that stage in your graduate studies yet, come up with a likely scenario. Describe it and discuss.**
I would probabily want for people to change it but not without my approval and check! for example im making a package for statistical analysis of time series then people in large scale data use the prediction algorithms and trust the results if anybody could change the source the validity of the result would not be certain
although having multiple contributors on it would help alot in terms of improving something with different perspectives

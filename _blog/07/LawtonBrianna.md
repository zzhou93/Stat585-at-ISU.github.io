## Blog 7 Responses

1. **Under what license does R operate?**

R operates under the GPL-2/GPL-3. Referenced from R Licenses (https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/)

2. **Answer the three questions listed above for the licenses: MIT, GPL-3,  LGPL-3, and CC-0. Note that some of the questions might not be answered with a simple yes/no. In that case, go into more detail, but do not just copy the terms of the license.**

## MIT License
The MIT License is a short and general permissive license with conditions that only require to preserve the copyright and license notices. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works can be distributed under different terms and without source code.

# 1. Are you and your collaborators fine with other people modifying your work and then sharing the modified work?
Yes, under the MIT License you can make changes to the work; you can use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute copies of the Software.

# 2. Are you and your collaborators fine with other people making a profit from those derivations?
Yes, under the MIT License you can sublicense and/or sell copies of the software; use the work commercially.

# 3. Who is responsible if your software does not do what it promises to do?
Under the MIT License, nobody is responsible; author is not liable; the software is provides "as it", without any kind of warranty. 

## GPL-3  means General Public License-version 3
The GPL-3 License is a strong license with conditions on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license. It also requires the Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights.

# 1. Are you and your collaborators fine with other people modifying your work and then sharing the modified work?
Yes, under the GPL-3 License you have permissions of distribution,modification, patent use, and private use with conditions of disclosing  the source code when distributed, a copy of the license and copyright notice must be included in the software, must use the same/similar license when modifications are distibuted, and changes made to the code but be stated.

# 2. Are you and your collaborators fine with other people making a profit from those derivations?
Yes, under the GPL-3 License the software and derivatives may be used for commercial use.It also states that
user have the rights to practice patent claims of contributors to the code, so users are open to use patented content.

# 3. Who is responsible if your software does not do what it promises to do?
Under the GPL-3 License, there is no warranty for the program to the extent permitted by applicable law except if copyright holders or other partie provide the program "as is" and if there is a merchant warranty or fitness for a particular purpose. Otherwise the entire risk and quality and performance of the program is on you(the person). The license also states that in no event unless required by law or previously agreed in writing will any copyright holder/other party who modifies or changes the program will not be liable for damages. The user has the ability to place warranty on the software licensed.

## LGPL-3 means Lesser General Public License-version 3
The LGPL-3 License is usually applied to libraries. There are conditions that require users to make the source code of licensed works or modifications available under the same license or the GNU GPLv3. Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. However, a larger work using the licensed work through interfaces provided by the licensed work may be distributed under different terms and without source code for the larger work.

# 1. Are you and your collaborators fine with other people modifying your work and then sharing the modified work?
Yes, under the LGPL-3 license you can copy, distribute and modify the software provided that modifications are described and licensed for free under LGPL. Derivatives works (including modifications or anything statically linked to the library) can only be redistributed under LGPL, but applications that use the library don't have to be.

# 2. Are you and your collaborators fine with other people making a profit from those derivations?
Yes, under the LGPL-3 license the software and derivatives can be used for commercial purposes. The LGPL-3 prohibits sublicensing, yet each user that receives the software automatically has the right to run, modify and distribute the work.

# 3. Who is responsible if your software does not do what it promises to do?
Under the LGPL-3 license, the software does provide a warranty and the author or copyright holder is not liable for any defects, damages, etc. 

# CC-0 means Creative Commons
The CC-0 License releases software into the public domain, or otherwise grants permission to use it for any purpose. This license also disclaims patent licenses.

# 1. Are you and your collaborators fine with other people modifying your work and then sharing the modified work?
Yes, under the CC-0 license you are open to modify the software and create derivatives, distribute the original and modified works.

# 2. Are you and your collaborators fine with other people making a profit from those derivations?
Yes, under the CC-0 license you have the ability to use the software for commerical purpose. 

# 3. Who is responsible if your software does not do what it promises to do?
Under the CC-0 License, information is available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under CC-0 terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons also disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible. Under CC0, no license is granted for trademark use.

## My Scenario of Use of Trademark
3. **Assume that you are in the process of making a package for your own graduate work. Describe considerations that come into play in deciding on a license. In case you are not quite at that stage in your graduate studies yet, come up with a likely scenario. Describe it and discuss.**

Scenario:
For a current research project I am working on, we have the tedious task of inputing data into excel sheets to record the time stamp of when a vehicle begins breaking and time stamp of when the vehicle reaches the stop bar or intersection head.If I am creating a package that is able to read a time stamp from video image data and record that time stamp the vehicle begins breaking and the time when the vehicle reaches the intersection stop bar and fill that in an excel sheet my life could be much easier! 
Therefore, if I was able to produce a successful package that executed these fucntions I would not mind sharing this information with other grad students or anyone to help them collect their data. I would only require the following:
1. I would want to make it open for people to use freely (copy and distribute) but not modify
1a. If an individual wants to modify they have to give credit to me, include my source code in every modification
2. I would not allow people to sell/make profit off my software unless they give me a percentage
3. Any modifications need to notify and send a copy to me the creator
Overall, I think the best license that would be suitable for the kind of package I have and the protections I am looking for would be closely related to the  AttributionNoncommercial-Share
Alike licence.

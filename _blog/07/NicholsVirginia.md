1. **Under what license does R operate?**
R allows you to look at the license by typing **either** *license()* or *licence()*. Either they are anticipating people mispelling it or it's like the color and colour both working in ggplot2. Either way I'm amused. 

R uses a **GPL-3** license. 

2. **Answer the three questions listed above for the licenses: MIT, GPL-3,  LGPL-3, and CC-0. Note that some of the questions might not be answered with a simple yes/no. In that case, go into more detail, but do not just copy the terms of the license.**

This is an interesting exercise with excellent timing. I am in the middle of workng with two datasets, produced under two different professor's tutelage. For the **first dataset**, I am in the process of working with the ISU library to publish it through DataShare. They asked me what license I wanted, and they had a hard time explaining things to me in plain language. *I'm actually meeting with the librarian on Thursday to talk about it. I think the 3 quesitons provided for this blog are an excellent starting place, and I will discuss them with my professor and present the answers to the librarian.* The **second dataset** was produced under a 'license', wherein my professor sells the data he produces to a company (Pioneer, I believe). So the data for the paper I'm submitting is not publicly available. I'm not happy about it, but I also don't completely understand it. I'll refer to the former data/professor unit as LabA and the latter as LabB. 

*1. Are you and your collaborators fine with other people modifying your work and then sharing the modified work?*
LabA = yes, LabB = only if they pay us

*2. Are you and your collaborators fine with other people making a profit from those derivations?*
LabA = I'm not sure. LabB = yes

*3. Who is responsible if your software does not do what it promises to do?*
LabA = LabB = us/me

3. **Assume that you are in the process of making a package for your own graduate work. Describe considerations that come into play in deciding on a license. In case you are not quite at that stage in your graduate studies yet, come up with a likely scenario. Describe it and discuss.**

I am uncomfortable with the idea of someone else taking publicly funded work and using it to make a profit without that profit trickling back in any way. This stems from the general decline in funding for public research. I also understand it's a fine line between wanting your work to be useful to other people, and not wanting them to make a killing by standing on your shoulders. For my packages (which will likely not lead to anything of profit) I'd like as many people to use them as possible, so while it makes me uncomfortable, I'd let my packages go out without any restrictions. 

I do feel like the agricultural private sector mooches off of publicly produced research all the time. I think the public sector should consider different licensing, in general. Something that allows it to be used for public good for free / at a discounted price compared to for-profit companies. Maybe that already exists, hidden in one of these license types....

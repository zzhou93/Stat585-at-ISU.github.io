Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 

The biggest mishap is sharing and changing raw code to other team members when we work a program together as a team.
but git is a "free and open source distributed version control system" that is really useful for collaborating on coding projects. we can collect the latest changes from our team members, and share changes to others via git.




2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

I'm interested in clone the new GitHub repository to your computer via RStudio. I can follow the direction like this:File > New Project > Version Control > Git. In "Repository URL", paste the URL of your new GitHub repository. 
I will find myself in a new local RStudio Project that represents the new test repo I just created on GitHub. That's fantastic and convinent.

##1.) **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 
The biggest mishap I have ever been involved in was caused by lack of communication. I was working on a project that involved a prospective marketing campaign during the Christmas season for my company. My role was data analysis, but there was representatives from marketing, supply chain, finance, and creative departments involved. While the end goal of our study was clear (is it worth it to increase advertisements on our products or not?), after our initial meeting we had not clearly specified what the next small step would be for each team member. A few weeks passed, and when we got back together everyone realized that nothing had been accomplished because each team member was waiting on someone else to do their part. We had wasted a lot of time doing nothing due to lack of communication. A collaborative tool like git or something similar would definitely help in a situation like this, as it is easier to see teammates' progress (or lack thereof) and diagnose any weak links in the chain. In fact, we implemented some collaborative tools to help avoid problems like this in the future and it significantly increased our group's efficiency.

##2.)**Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.
I'm new to git and I want to organize some of my old R projects and upload them, so I read Chapter 17. The biggest feature I learned about in that chapter is the relatively simple interface between Rstudio and Github that allowed me to upload my (old, not necessarily organized) projects to Github without too much difficulty. Not only are the files now on display just the way I want them, but I can continue working on them without any interruptions. All it took was a few steps, and there were only a few minor issues.

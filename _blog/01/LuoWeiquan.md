Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 

My worst experience was a two-people project that lost files. It was a thermal dynamic course project that designed an appropriate arrangement of fuel pipelines for cooling purpose around the rocket nozzle in order to ensure the max temperature of nozzles was not excess. I completed an excel document that included the setup of the formula of hydraulic properties of the fuel. My teammate downloaded it and ready to test for the performance of cooling. I understood his effort more than a week was crucial for the whole project, but the field was lost for some reason. Then we lost all his work. If we used Git, he could often upload the files to the remote repository for safe storage, instead of local. At the same time, I could obtain a copy of his work whild checking his progress. By using git or Github, he did not need to redo the work for another week. Therefore, storing project files in cloud forces the project team member to upload and update his effort to avoid problems such as missing files and miscommunication. 

2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

From Jenny Bryan's book, I learn how to connect Rstudio to git and GitHub. As an intermediate git user, I have not used just Git via software including Git Client and editor. Even I learn source tree from this book, but it seems not so benifit to my life. However, since I often use R, I do have a need to upload my progress for my project team. Git is different from Dropbox, which is easily accessed to great version control feature. It helps to track the progress of projects. With the capacity of interacting GitHub via Rstudio, it is more convenient to store my file to cloud by clicking on Git tap on Rstudio IDE.

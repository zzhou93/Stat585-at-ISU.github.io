1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 

I'm not sure I can point to one biggest mishap, but I can certainly point to a common one: unequal contribution. I have often used GoogleDocs to write group papers, but once the document is downloaded as a PDF and submitted to the professor, it is no longer possible to attribute an individual's work to that individual. Github certainly provides a solution to this problem as the PDF can be submitted through a public or shared repository, allowing the professor to track changes over time and get a better picture of contribution across group members over time and interpret peer evaluations or assign grades accordingly.

2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

I liked learning the keyboard shortcuts "t" (to activate the file finder in a repo's file or directory) and "y" (to get a permanent link to a file that won't change when a file is renamed or otherwise changed).

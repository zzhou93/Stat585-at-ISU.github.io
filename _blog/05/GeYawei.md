###1.Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.

**1. Summarize Roger Peng¡¯s outline for reproducibility in Biostatistics.**

Peng stated the policy the *Biostatistics* has adopted to improve the reproducibility of papers in the journal. He has listed three dimensions of reproducibility the journal using to rate the degree of reproducibility of a paper and the corresponding requirements.

1. Data, authors can choose to share their data on the website

2. Code, authors can choose to share the code used to do calculation and get their main results

3. Reproducible, if an author choose to make their academic process reproducible, the Associate Editor for reproducibility(AER) will make sure the paper is reproducible using the supplementary materials.

Other supplementary and necessary files are also required if they are necessary to reproduce the result and understand it.

**2. What are Keiding¡¯s main criticisms of the proposal?.**

The main criticism is that the proposal will overemphasis the data itself and the statistical computation processes and ignore the important substantive context of the study. And he also critize that researchers should do more work on problem-oriented study instead of generalizing the methods to trivial data sets. He also emphasises the importance of cooperation of statistian and substantive scientists and critize simplifying the reproduciable issue to data and statistical coding(numbers and code).

**3. Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**

The points in response to Keiding's ciriticism from Peng are impressive to me. Some of his points are stating that(in my words and understanding) as a Journal, we should know what we can do and what we cannot do. Even if the ciritisim is reasonable, we have no way to implement the full idea it provides. And what is important is that we can provide some help through a relatively easier and straightforward way to someone who wants to understand the process and make use of the results through reproduing the academic process. Even if someone can use this data and code improperly to producing their results and generalize the method in a way Keid doesn't like, it doesn't mean we shouldn't do this because it has much more benifits. And personally, I agree with this, the purpose of the journal is not solving every proplem you might think of and preventing people using it in a way you don't like, what important is how we can help those needing this help instead of leading the direction of research fields which is too much expectation for a jornal. We should provide more help to simplify the reproduce process, but using it wisely is the researcher's duty not journal.



**4. How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**

He agrees with Peng's claim that this proposal is a minimal requirement and better documentation of computation is needed. He also agrees that the statistical computaion is not ususlly trivial. But he strongly disagrees that many statistian have the substantive knowledge needed to do analysis. The statisticians who are also the leaders in the substantive application area are just minority. This is consistent with his opinion in his first response.

###2. Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on dta related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?

Well, since I haven't ever been in a very complex research project with a lot of collaborative work, I haven't met too many difficulties for reproducibility. When I were working on a data analysis project within a group, I needed to share my periodical progress with partners and I just sent emails with necessary code and data. As said in Blog1, I may use github to make this a better experience and alternatively, to ensure the reproducibility, I would have added more ducumentation in my code to help my partners to understand the codes instead of just being able to run it as a whole script and see the results. I should spend more time on the documentation for my partners and future self.

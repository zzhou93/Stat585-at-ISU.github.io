## Prompt:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Write a short (100-150 words) summary of the chapter you read in-depth.**
2. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 
3. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.
